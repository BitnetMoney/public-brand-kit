# Public Brand Kit

A compilation of assets and resources for community content creation for Bitnet.

## Contributing

This is an open source repository and anyone can contribute by submitting their own assets or making improvement suggestions.  
  
### Are you submitting new assets and/or resources?

The criteria for merging pull requests with new assets and/or resources is that it only has to follow existing standards and primarily use the existing color palette.

### Are you changing or updating the color palette?

For that you need to initiate a discussion in one or more of Bitnet's public social media platforms, such as Discord, Telegram, or Reddit. After community input, if your suggestions are accepted, in principle, by the majority of participant members, you can submit your pull request. *Don't forget to provide evidence of the community discussions in the comment section of your PR.*

### Are you making any significant or substantial changes to the brand?

Evidence of broader community discussions will be required for merging any changes that significantly alter the look and feel of the logo or brand. A minimum of 4 weeks cooldown will apply for merging any of such PRs.
